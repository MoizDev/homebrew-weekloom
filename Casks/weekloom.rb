  # ⚠️ `~/.weekloom` is deliberately NOT listed here. It is the user's entire
  # plan — the one SQLite file this application exists to keep — and an
  # uninstall must not take it. Someone reinstalling gets their boards back.

  # ⚠️ Weekloom is ad-hoc signed, not signed with a paid Apple Developer ID, so
  # macOS quarantines it and Gatekeeper refuses to launch it — reporting that
  # the app is "damaged", which is false and which people reasonably act on by
  # deleting it. Homebrew removed `--no-quarantine` and offers no cask-level
  # way to decline the attribute, so clearing it here is the only way the
  # install can be a single command that produces a working app.
  #
  # This is exactly what the user would otherwise be told to type themselves.
  # Delete this block the day the app is notarized — it stops being needed, and
  # a cask that strips quarantine from a NOTARIZED app is only throwing away a
  # real signal.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Weekloom is ad-hoc signed rather than notarized with a paid Apple Developer
    ID. The quarantine flag that would make macOS call it "damaged" has been
    cleared for you, so it should just open.
